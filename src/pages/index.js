              <h3>Web Programming</h3>
              <p>
              The academic services of Widyatama University Information System Study Program are still conducted conventionally,
               especially in the process of registration of practical work and submission of theses which are still done by manually registering the files submitted to the administration. 
               It really requires a relatively long processing time. Therefore i need to find solutions to solve problems that occur in academic services by creating an Academic Information System website. 
              Web-based academic information systems in Widyatama University Information System covering several factors, 
              namely data management systems ranging from lecturer, student data,
               intenrnship registration, thesis submission and there is also making reports using a codeigniter framework.
